# Project Title

Stock Market Prediction system is used to predict stock price using Machine Learning technique called LSTM(long short-term memory), a time-series forecasting model which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Python, where we have a dataset contain a lot of Google stock price from years 2012 to 2017.



# Dataset

The dataset used here is dowloaded from Kaggle

# Coding Section

In this part we will see the project code divided to sections as follows:

Section 1 | Data Preprocessing :
In this section we aim to do some operations on the dataset before training the model on it,
processes like :

Load dataset
Check for duplicates and remove them
Check for missing data for each column
Creating rolling mean values for 7 days


Section 2 | Model Creation :
The dataset is ready for training, so we create a LSTM(long short-term memory), a time-series forecasting model which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)is created

Section 3 | Model Evaluation :
Finally we evaluate the model by getting accuracy, classification report and confusion matrix.
